These are my python + CS notes, sorted as pop-up buttons on an HTML page. 
They are focused on things I have struggled with or found amusing and may not be entirely useful to a new learner. 

As I don't want to type new code for each section, I have created a basic tkinter app to do it for me, 
it only takes my input - category name and content. 

My goal here is to encounter real project issues, as well as come back and optimize or recreate stuff as I learn and grow.

The GUI app runs when starting the gui_main.py file. 


It works by replacing placeholders in the HTML file using the ContentManager class.
